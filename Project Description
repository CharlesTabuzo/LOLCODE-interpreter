The LOLCODE Interpreter Project focuses on creating a functional interpreter for the LOLCODE programming language, which is known for its humorous and meme-inspired syntax. This project typically involves implementing key components such as:

Lexical Analysis: Breaking down LOLCODE source code into tokens.

Parsing: Validating the structure of the code and constructing internal representations.

Evaluation: Executing the code by interpreting variables, expressions, and control flow.

The interpreter may support features like variable handling, arithmetic operations, logical expressions, and conditional statements. It often serves as a learning tool for understanding programming language concepts like syntax, semantics, and compiler design.
